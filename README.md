## Error Logs

### Error 1: Problem Statement
**TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'headersSent')**

**Cause**:  
This occurred because the `res` object was improperly handled in middleware or routing.

**Solution**:
```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    if (res.headersSent) {
        return next(err);
    }
    res.status(500).send({ error: err.message });
});
